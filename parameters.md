# Musical Parameters

- [x] Volume
- [x] Pitch
- [ ] Reverb
- [ ] Tempo
- [ ] Filters (low, high, band, etc.)
- [ ] Repetition (trigger some form of looping)
- [ ] Chorus/Voices (create arrangements of current audio pitched up/down around the original track)

## Control Mechanism

Make some gesture which puts you in a specific mode then use hand tracking to modulate from there. Avoids needing DJ to keep hand somewhere. Makes tool less active, more use when you want. Does not provide simultaneous control.

To allow modulating multiple parameters enable user to set parameter then exit mode without clearing. A clenched fist clears all parameters at any time.

Allowing looping would also add back in more functionality.
